## Takeaways:
* Bayesian black boxes -> we can create something that is general, but in particular case include domain knowlege (or other - a deduced prior). Learning for general, applying for specific (prior).

## To check
* Nonparametric Models
* Subjective Bayesian
* PAC-Bayesian
* [[Empirical Bayes]]
