## Guidelines
* Store page specific artifacts in the related folder under the artifact type folder (ex. imgs related to the Lectures pages are stored in the Lectures/imgs etc.)
* Start each page by tagging it with related topic template ex. page in lectures should have tag -> 00_Lectures. This helps with organizing the graph representation.
* Have fun!
